The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/10272854/8dcca016_original.jpg,3159,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3159,Daniel,2008-09-24,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Upon arriving in Amsterdam, one can imagine asking oneself: Where is the fun nightlife?

I hope you'll enjoy my boat as much as I do. After 23 years of living on the water, I'm still stunned by  the beauty of it. My favorite spot is on my terrace in the early morning. Sitting in the sun overlooking the water enjoying a cup of coffee. But even when it rains it's a wonderful experience. To see the drops fall into the water with great force...

I came to his city in 1982 and probably will never leave anymore. I love my city, my house, my family, my friends and many other things. Really Amsterdam, ‘ the biggest village on earth’, offers so many beautiful things. We love to bike down town for coffee, shopping at the organic Noord Market or the so called Nine Streets, strolling in the Vondelpark, going to Paradiso or theatre with our daughters.  Many times we feel like tourists in our own town! 
I was educated as teacher French and Dutch but switched to the fashion industry as there was not enough work in teaching at that time. As a fashion agent I sell woman clothes to shops. As my business becomes more difficult the last year I decided to start b&b, and I love it. 
I also love to go hiking in the Alps or reading my books in our beach hut  at half an hour from where we live. 
I love going to cinema especially documentaries and art house films, and: yoga, meeting family and friends.

If you stay with us, there is a big chance that you meet my partner Karel as well. His work is project manager for art in public space. He is even a more enthousiatic mountaineer as I am: he also loves to climb the rocks as well. And when I am reading my book he is a probably out for sailing on the sea in his Laser. 
 
My two daughters can give you the best advices where to spend your money with shopping. They are working hard at school and dreaming and saving money for their round-the-world-trip within a few years.

In 2013 we bought the boat "" The Calidris"". The main reason to live on a boat was to stay in the city, but still had enough space and above all, freedom. It feels like a little community in this street, because the boat people hang out together, help eachother and know eachother well.

We are very happy to live in such a special place in Amsterdam, enough space, nice views, but still connected to the city! We like cooking together, traveling with our 3 boys, designing our home or making trips with our camper.

In 2014 we started our B&B. Where you sleep now, it used to be the captain's cabin. We immediately removed the stairs, so we do not miss the space at all. It as always a dream for me to run a little boutique hotel. Nowadays we don't run a hotel, but a pittoresque B&B, which we really enjoy. It is fun to meet people all over the world who mostly have a great time at our boat. When you would like to see how houseboat-people live just knock on the door and we will show you around!
