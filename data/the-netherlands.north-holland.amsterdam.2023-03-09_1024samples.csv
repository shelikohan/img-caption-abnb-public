The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/10272854/8dcca016_original.jpg,3159,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3159,Daniel,2008-09-24,"Amsterdam, Netherlands","Upon arriving in Amsterdam, one can imagine asking oneself: Where is the fun nightlife?

I came to his city in 1982 and probably will never leave anymore. I love my city, my house, my family, my friends and many other things. Really Amsterdam, ‘ the biggest village on earth’, offers so many beautiful things. We love to bike down town for coffee, shopping at the organic Noord Market or the so called Nine Streets, strolling in the Vondelpark, going to Paradiso or theatre with our daughters.  Many times we feel like tourists in our own town! 
I was educated as teacher French and Dutch but switched to the fashion industry as there was not enough work in teaching at that time. As a fashion agent I sell woman clothes to shops. As my business becomes more difficult the last year I decided to start b&b, and I love it. 
I also love to go hiking in the Alps or reading my books in our beach hut  at half an hour from where we live. 
I love going to cinema especially documentaries and art house films, and: yoga, meeting family and friends.

If you stay with us, there is a big chance that you meet my partner Karel as well. His work is project manager for art in public space. He is even a more enthousiatic mountaineer as I am: he also loves to climb the rocks as well. And when I am reading my book he is a probably out for sailing on the sea in his Laser. 
 
My two daughters can give you the best advices where to spend your money with shopping. They are working hard at school and dreaming and saving money for their round-the-world-trip within a few years.

In 2013 we bought the boat "" The Calidris"". The main reason to live on a boat was to stay in the city, but still had enough space and above all, freedom. It feels like a little community in this street, because the boat people hang out together, help eachother and know eachother well.

We are very happy to live in such a special place in Amsterdam, enough space, nice views, but still connected to the city! We like cooking together, traveling with our 3 boys, designing our home or making trips with our camper.

In 2014 we started our B&B. Where you sleep now, it used to be the captain's cabin. We immediately removed the stairs, so we do not miss the space at all. It as always a dream for me to run a little boutique hotel. Nowadays we don't run a hotel, but a pittoresque B&B, which we really enjoy. It is fun to meet people all over the world who mostly have a great time at our boat. When you would like to see how houseboat-people live just knock on the door and we will show you around!

Surrounded with restaurants, terraces and shops this is one if the best locations in the city, because it’s in the middle of where all happens yet in a quiet street. In my house I offer two double bed & coffee rooms each with a private shower and one room even with a bath. I live in the building and I have my own bathroom. A bed & coffee room means your rent a b&b room, but instead of breakfast with unlimited coffee and tea that you make with your own Nespresso maker. The building offers a pretty unique large roof terrace that is magically lit by night. 

I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

B&B Lisenced by council of Amsterdam.

We love AIrbnb. It is a great concept. We are proud te be a member of this community and love to explore the world at other Airbnb nice places. We introduce ourselves.
We arrived in Amsterdam in 1992 ( Michiel) and 1994 (Marlous) for doing our study and since then we didn’t leave this amazing city (except all the travels and work experiences abroad) so we discovered the city at early age ( with experiencing all the good and bad things), started our career over here and now we have our family life in this lovely neighborhood which feels like a modern upgraded ghetto in the middle of the energetic city of Amsterdam.

We enjoy our family life with the kids who goes to school and has there friends nearby and playgrounds are all over around (our garden, “Vondelpark”, “Museumplein”) and within a second we leave the house for a movie (at Cinecenter Cinema near ""Leidseplein"" is our favorite) or a theatre (Stadsschouwburg at ""Leidseplein"" which also has lots of International Plays) or having drinks with friends in one of the bars or restaurant nearby (the “Pijp” or the Jordaan”). All within a short distance or a 10 or 20 minute walk. 

We love to work hard as an Photographer and an Advocate and doing sports like racecycling, jogging, yoga and we all play tennis. We do love art and painting. We loved to travel around the world and now with our kids we downsized the distance to overcome and explore Europe with his nice countries like Italia (our favorite till so far is the lovely place Lucca) and Austria (for skieing and staying in a nice family village like Zell am See), Turkey (with the charming surfing hotspot of Alacati) and our favorite cities like Paris ( we love to eat a croissant with our kids in Parque Luxembourg) and Tarifa (for hanging around in this kite-surfing place paradise). We also enjoy simply going to the nearby beaches of Bloemendaal (Beachclub Republiek), Zandvoort ( Family Beach Vooges) or Noordwijk (Beachclub Zuiderbad) and we love to overstay a weekend in our familyhouse in Zeeland. We enjoying life with our friends and being with our lovely kids.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already.

In 2001 I started hosting guests in my garden room. Guests from all over the world stayed here. 
I traveled the world the last 30 years because of my work and know how important it is to feel at home when you are away from home.
I believe in changing the world to a better world by starting here and now, making the change. I love to do yoga and workout in the gym, go for a run or bike ride. We do not have a car. If we need a car we rent a green wheels car. 
In 2015 we installed 13 solar panels on the roof, in 2016 another 6 solar panels. We have renovated a big part of our 5 stories house: 75 % of the windows are isolated, we have a hot water regain installation on the top floors, a water descaling machine for the entire house (descaled water reduces the use of detergents and soaps/shampoos and extends the lifetime of washing machine and dish washer).
Our family is  non-smoking and we eat mostly vegetarian, because we think it contributes to a better, cleaner and more sustainable world
We  believe in personal, mindful and sustainable, eco friendly tourism: enjoy our beautiful city with respect for the environment,   inhabitants and other visitors of Amsterdam.

I'm aware of environmental issues, and I do my best to recycle when possible (plastics, paper, glass, old clothes etc). The electricity in my house is mostly generated from windmills. I'm not a car owner and I go everywhere by bicycle - which is very easy to do living in Amsterdam! 

International affairs interests me and I like to keep track of issues in countries like Venezuela, Colombia, Asia, Europe, the UK (Brexit??!), Ireland and Spain, among others.

Modern art is another interest, and living in Amsterdam there is no shortage of great museums to see art in, the Stedelijk museum being one of my favourites.

At 44 I started my own Soap business in Januari 2015: De Amsterdamsche Zeepfabriek B.V. The Amsterdam Soap Factory, in Amsterdam. A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

At 44 I started my own Soap business in Januari 2015: De Amsterdamsche Zeepfabriek B.V. The Amsterdam Soap Factory, in Amsterdam. A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

I like music very much and hope you will enjoy the grand piano. It's an old Bechstein piano. If you can't play, the piano is also useful to put your glass on. I enjoy the Beatles, Bruce, Led Zeppelin and Status Quo. I'm 51, music preference seems to be burned into ones DNA. The boys are very much into sports, as is Marcia.

After living in Amsterdam for 22 years and having become a consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, my wife Patty and I, together with our 3 young children, moved to a place closer to the sea and nature. As a base, we can still be found regularly in our cozy beach apartment in Noordwijk aan Zee. This apartment is located on the 3rd floor of a 5-floor building and has completely been renovated in 2019.

Because the balcony is quite large, with a sea view, and is conveniently located on the sun (south/west), you can enjoy everything that happens on the beach and in the sea all day long.

Due to the large parking lot at the rear of the apartment complex, you will have no problems finding a parking space and you will eventually only have to cross the boulevard to walk to the beach. There are several beach clubs situated that provide sunbed rental and nice food /drinks, so that you will be completely pampered.

The center of Noordwijk aan Zee with its many shops and restaurants is also about a 10-minute walk from the apartment.

Our main goal is to let you feel comfortable in our apartment and hope you have a wonderfull stay in Noordwijk aan Zee!

With kind regards,

Erik and Patty Salentijn-Roosen

My name is Corina, Dutch citizen in the historical city center of Amsterdam. After I have travelled the world quite a bit, Amsterdam is the place where I raise my son (now 12!). Besides of being a busy mother, I am an entrepreneur and yes, we have a b&b on the ground floor of our fantastic house in the Jordaan, the vibrant heart of Amsterdam. A special b&b as we do not serve breakfast. Dutch regulations that is and we kind of like it that way. We strongly recommend that you go out for breakfast... as our neighbors are specialized in making you a good breakfast. We guarantee you will never be hungry during your stay in Amsterdam. 

We love happy caring guests who love to explore Amsterdam by foot as all city highlights are closeby. And we collect special traveltips in Amsterdam for our guests....  Our location is our very best asset! We strongly encourage to experience Amsterdam like it is... like we love it. Happy strolling around from highlight to highlight. We are Amsterdam and the place is Amsterdam. It is as it is. However, if something is disappointing or missing, please let us know so that we can help you and/or correct it. 

Sometimes we get interesting requests like is there a kitchen? No, sorry but we offer coffee & tea facilities in the room and it comes with a small fridge. If you need plates, just ask please. Another question: Can we use your wash machine? No sorry, but there are laundry services in the city, plus we do not like it if you wash clothes in the bathroom and hang them in the room and garden... as you might understand. Or: Can we use drugs in the garden? No, our place is smoke and drugs free. However, during your stay you can smoke a couple of cigarettes in the backside of the garden, but if your plan is to smoke there every hour, better find another place as I provide my son with a smoke and drugs free home. And many more questions like what is a lit jumeaux? Can I have an early check in? In general that is not possible BUT you can store your luggage in our corridor on arrival and take the key. We will try to get the room clean & ready asap for your after 11 o clock. Same for the day of departure: you can store your luggage in the corridor and pick it up by the time you are ready to leave Amsterdam. Easy going & as flexible as we can. 

My son & I love to travel and we love to explore new places. Mostly in and around Amsterdam but also abroad. Besides of working hard, we have an active lifestyle and we like to sport.  I run (mostly Vondelpark), I swim (Marnixbad and sometimes open water) and I play basketbal like my son. We love to do outdoor sports as well, like hiking, canoeing, skiing, etc. 

My son has bought two bikes to rent out to guests but so far the adventure got stuck and the bikes are in the corridor for repair. Soon he will boost his entrepreneurial plan..

We absolutely love welcoming happy guests and we do love the airbnb concept. You pay the price that is quoted by AirBnB and  we pay all the taxes necessary to be able to host you and we like it that way. No hidden costs. Well, except the bikes by the time you can rent them...

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Born and raised in Amsterdam,  traveling the States for work for the last couple of years.

This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I am a free lance journalist, podcaster and writer with a fascination for the human ability to adapt to the challenges of life and the the biggest challenge of all: living together, making democracy work.   Both fascinations are ever-present in the USA, so that'w where I find my stories.  

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. In 2016, I started surfing and have taken every chance ever since to catch waves.  

I started booking with airbnb in 2011  and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place  decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world in 2014. I really do believe the sharing experience adds to the any stay, anywhere. My home is not a holiday rental - I care to share it with travelers who enjoy the sharing and local kind of travel and treat a home that same way.

I'm Carry, a 35 year old woman from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I love to travel and I take every opportunity I get to go abroad! Besides traveling I enjoy being with friends, food, weight training, biking, nature, hiking, metal smithing, baking sweets and lots more.

In 2010 I have traveled through South America as a backpacker together with my sister for about 10 months and fell in love with the continent, especially with Argentina and Buenos Aires. I have been going back yearly and recently lived there for a couple of years as well. 
In 2016-2017 my sister and I lived and traveled in New Zealand with a working holiday visa, so that was another great adventure where we used Airbnb regularly :)

I like to join this platform both as a host and a guest. When possible, I offer my apartment in Amsterdam to fellow travelers during my own holidays.

In my profile I said I speak Spanish, because I do understand most of it. I'm far from fluent though, especially my speech isn't good!

In case I’m abroad either my mother Regien or sister Belle will be your host and handle both the check-in and check-out. In that case their contact information will be available to you after booking.

If you have any questions feel free to ask, I'll be happy to answer :)

Some of my hobbies are travelling,  Ibiza, (race) cycling, my work, cars, soccer and my close friends and family. 

We started this company 20 years ago. In April 2013 we started with renting out through Airbnb. With our experience in letting out to expats from the biggest Multinationals (Shell/Unilever/Johnson&Johnson) we know what people expect in a temporary apartment. 

We try to develop our apartments in a tasteful neutral style with high quality finishing and - furniture on nice locations like the Amsterdam Jordaan Area. Our apartments are not on the busiest places of Amsterdam but always on a maximum 3 minute walk from the canals. 

All our (Amsterdam)apartments are fully licensed by town hall what means that safety is on place 1. Infrared smoke detectors, flight plans, not too many people in 1 flat, no drugs etc.

We try to offer a hotel idea but than in an apartment. So more privacy, luxury, convenience and space on a AAA location but for a better price!

A definite no go is asking for a discount. If our prices are too high I would suggest to rent a bed where the owner was in the night before. 

Also we dont accept guests without any reviews. No exceptions. Sorry.


What is also convenient in our opinion is that we do not live our selves in the apartments. So You dont  sleep on a bed where someone has slept on for 5 years already. 

After every guest the apartments are professionally cleaned and so are  the towels and bedlinen by a professional company.

please see our reviews for confirmation if you are not convinced yet!

My stay was excellent and the houseboat contributed a large part to that. It is located in one of the best locations of the city: next to the Jordaan and close to the Westermarkt (with Anne Frank house). It is very quiet on the water even though the city is hustling around you. Sitting outside, looking out over the water is a great experience. Weekends the canal is a bit busier with lots of small boats coming through but it create a unique atmosphere that you will not find in any of the hotels. The houseboat itself is unique so it is hard to describe, it is not small, but it does create an intimate atmosphere. I can see it would be great for a romantic stay (even though I stayed alone Lachebekje (zwart-wit)). The layout makes that the sleeping part is separated from the kitchen/living part even though there are no doors between the sections. The bed is excellent, the shower strong and hot, the kitchen fully equipped, lots of books to read and music to play. But most of the time you will be sitting outside enjoying the view of the canal and the sounds of the city. The nights and morning could be a bit chilly but heather worked just fine. I would recommend the houseboat to anyone who would like ta truly unique Amsterdam experience.

What an amazing boat and location! We spent most of our visit sitting on the back deck...and watching the symphony of the city happen around us. The bed was comfy (and I am picky), the fresh flowers were nice. We also enjoyed feeding the momma and daddy ducks with their babies. We will return and we hope the boat is available when we do.

The houseboat was awesome - everything we expected. Fake was a wonderful hosts and the houseboat had everything we needed. We had a small problem with the heat and Fake came over so quickly. It was really a simple button to reset that was all but I hadn't figured it out. The location is fantastic too - really I think best neighborhood in Amsterdam. What a treat to experience Amsterdam this way. I highly recommend it.

El houseboat fue realmente muy confortable , conseguía que te sintieras como en casa y el lugar donde esta situado es simplemente espectacular, cerca de restaurantes, tiendas - se hace hasta un mercado semanal en la zona donde comprar productos de alimentación frescos, bio.....etc Una familia de patos te visita cada día y se mueren por el pan!!!

Es war alles perfekt, die Fotos geben das Boot realistisch wider, Fake war zuverlässig und sehr nett im Kontakt, der Besitzer sehr serviceorientiert und freundlich. Das Bett ist sehr komfortabel, die Ausstattung völlig ausreichend. Die Lage ist wirklich absolut zentral und alles ist fußläufig gut erreichbar. Wir könne die Unterkunft auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und werden wiederkommen, wenn das Boot frei ist.

I work in the film industrie and had one of the leading casting agencies of the Netherlands for 25 years. During this period  i used to travel a lot, where I  participated in many  feature films and television series abroad. Now I work as a Assistant Director in film and I have my B&B. I love to do both very much.  

I love traveling and also have lived abroad. That is how I found out what I needed of a B&B. A home away from home!


One of the things I  really enjoy about my  B&B is to meet travellers  from all around the world and facilitated them so they  have a great time or moment in Amsterdam.

People who have visited my place have all felt very welcome here. 
Please see the reviews.

 It's  a perfect place to relax after a day's work at the RAI or after a day or night  of visiting the town.

Together with my husband Henk we have this beautiful ship. It's an old ship from 1897. In the old days this boat had cargo on board and sailed across the sea from Holland to Denmark and Sweden.

Nowadays we are sailing in the Summer with groups of people on board who have a sailing holiday and in the winter we are moored in the beautiful city of Amsterdam. We stay here on one spot. I like to have people on board who enjoy being together.

 I am a woman of the sea and everything that has to do with water has an enormous attraction on me! I love life and take care of myself by eating healthy food, walking in nature with our dog and practice yoga, and sail in the summer of course!

Carpe Diem!

So when you want a nice and special place in the World city of Amsterdam, come on board and feel at home on our ship! We are pleased to welcome you!

I'm Micha from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 

After having had 1 year off, I start working again in Amsterdam.

I left my city & job to be able to study Spanish & travel through Middle and South America. I stayed at several Airbnb places and  enjoyed it big time! Nice locations, clean and proper rooms with especially very friendly local hosts!
Now my own apartment is ready too (just recently moved),  I'll definitely list it too.

The combination of a open and friendly culture, beautiful environments and nice people are the perfect combination to me when traveling.

In general: I like to travel, as we all do ;)
For the rest: cooking
sports: kite-surf, ice-skating (the Dutch way) & running in the Amsterdam parks, skiing, swimming & driving my motorcycle

3. PERSONAL STORY IN DUTCH

PLEASE READ MY HOUSERULES BEFORE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION OF THE 2 ROOMS! YOU ARE VERY WELCOME IF YOU FOLLOW MY HOUSERULES. I LIKE TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION WITH YOU. 
AND IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH MY HOUSERULES, PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE A RESERVATION OF THE 2 ROOMS! THANK YOU.

So first a short story in english:

Hello everybody!
Introducung myself:

People call me extrovert, social and spontaneous. But the interaction with you, will also be influenced by your wishes and needs of course!
As an AIRBNB host I can prepare you tea or coffee with the dutch treat WARM SIRUP WAFELS, when you check in!
Travelling gives me a feeling of overwhelming freedom. I just love to travel around on our world with just 1 backpack. It can be challenging, interesting, exciting, squary, adventurous or horrible! I've been in more then 90 countries and my curiosity becomes bigger after every journey each year.
I also love to collect comic books, have almost 7000.
It means adventure and freedom to me.
When I read them I have the opportunity to travel around in my head.

I live in Amsterdam since 1988. At the moment in the cosey area DE PIJP.
In a beautiful apartment on floor 3 and 4, with a balcony and wonderful roofterrace, on stock 5. 

I have 2 rooms in this apartment which I rent for 3 guests. It is also possible to stay with 4 guests. But be aware: one of the  rooms is quite small for 2 guests. Check in time from 12.00 and check out time at 11.00.
These times are flexible ONLY when I do not have other guests checking in. Sometimes I have to work elsewhere. So let me know which check time you prefer. We have to sort out what the possibilities are. Some guests leave their luggage in my living room, during the check out day. Only possible if I do not need to work or have no outdoor apointments. And pick it up later.
Be aware that I'm living in this apartment, too. We do not need to share toilet and shower on floor 3. Because that is mine. You have YOUR shower and toilet on floor 4. We do need to share the use of the kitchen on floor 3. Although this was never a problem, I experienced after renting out for 3,5 years!
I am not always at home during your stay. Sometimes I need to work or have other apointments. You go your way. I will go mine.

MY HOUSE RULES:

The 2 rooms are available FROM 12.00 mostly. You need to leave the rooms at 11.00, because I need to clean them for the next guests. 

Please do not reserve the 2 rooms if you want 100 % privacy. Because I live in the apartment, too. We need to share the use of the kitchen. Where you can make yourself fresh coffee or tea. Or cook, bake or boil.

And use your own 2 fridges in your 2 rooms, please. Instead of mine.

Also be aware that the 2 rooms are very small! They do not have a lot of space to walk around.
The bathroom is comfortable.

And the 4 stairs are steep and narrow. Do not book these rooms if you have trouble climbing stairs. Not suitable if you come with heavy luggage or a baby! 

Take off your shoes before you enter my apartment. I do not want any shoes anymore in my apartment. To avoid dogshit and street dirt.

No loud noises in my house, corridor  or on the street. There are neighbours living on floor 1 and 2!

Help me to collect plastic and paper in different garbage cans in the kitchen.

Do not smoke in the apartment or in the 2 rooms.
You can smoke on the balcony or roofterrace.

No need to do any dishwashing. Just put your dirty plates or glasses etc in my dishwashing machine in the kitchen.

And enjoy your stay.

Maybe I will meet you when we travel around!
I wish you lots of inspiring journeys!
Maybe we will see each other in the future,
Kind regards, bye, adios, ciao, au revoir (Website hidden by Airbnb) Olaf

Hallo reizigers,

Welkom op mijn profiel. Ik woon in de gezellige buurt DE PIJP, vlakbij het mooie Sarphatipark. In deze buurt hoef je je nooit te vervelen. Er zijn enorm veel verschillende soorten cafés en restaurants. De Albert Cuyp markt is elke dag open, behave zondag. Leuke winkeltjes en koffie bars in deze buurt. Voor een mooie film kan je naar Filmhuis Rialto. In het van Ostade theater worden diverse voorstellingen uitgevoerd. Een wandeling langs de Amstel aan de oostzijde is verrukkelijk. Ja, ik ben domweg gelukkig in de pijp.

Ik heb een apartement op etage 3 en 4.
En ik verhuur 2 kleine kamers op etage 4 aan 3 gasten. Dus vrijwel nooit aan 4 gasten. De 2 kamers hebben ook een eigen douche en toilet.
Ik woon zelf ook in het apartement, dus als je de 2 kamers huurt, moet je de keuken en balkon- op etage 3- en dakterras op etage 5, delen met mij. 
Check in: na 12.00 en uitchecken: om 11.00. Deze tijden zijn soms flexibel. Bijv. als er op de uitcheck dag geen andere gasten inchecken voor de 2 kamers.
Misschien tot in de toekomst.

Met warme groeten van Olaf

I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

Afgelopen jaar hebben wij onze bungalow aangeschaft en geheel gerenoveerd naar hoe we het zelf zouden willen aan treffen als wij iets huren, het is met veel liefde en aandacht gedaan, en we hopen dan ook dat onze gasten het er heerlijk naar hun zin zullen hebben en met mooie herinneringen weer weg gaan.

Vele jaren geleden zijn wij op deze plek verliefd geworden op de Veluwe en genieten er nog iedere keer van als we in het bos lopen. Wij hopen dat u een heerlijk verblijf heeft, en vaak terug komt omdat u dezelfde ervaring mag hebben zoals wij die ervaren.

A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

My house is now the most beautiful loft-house in Amsterdam. A bit hippy. You might want to have a glass with me at the rooftop. I'll think about it ;)

first line of a poem by Roman Emperor Hadrian 138 AC
Meaning Little soul, little wanderer, little charmer.

Once a traveler, always a traveler. If it isn't outbound, it's inward. And it isn't about the destination. It's about the road.  Going up and down, left and right. Sometimes welcoming with lots of comfortable hide aways. Challenging at all times. 

I prefer the word Tao. Literary meaning way, path or route. Because it clarifies the point of traveling which is to cross borders, going beyond the clearly visible, the well sign posted and known world and even beyond the world of physical appearances all together. 

Many years ago I set out traveling to expand my geographical map. I end up expanding my mind map. 

I like to share with you the place I call home. As a resting place for you on your travels through life. 

I manage to earn a living as a yoga teacher with some side hustles. I run a little webshop and I work as a chef or a hostess in the catering business. I love my partner who lives oversees like he’s Romeo and I am Juliette. I love my two beautiful daughters.

Cycling through the city, across the bridges and next to the canals always puts a very large smile on our faces! 

We invite you to come and explore all the magic this city has to offer!

We are Bas and Mirte, around 35 yrs old and we live in Amsterdam with our two little kids ages 2 and 4.
Our motto for life is work hard, play hard: Mirte is a marketing manager in FMCG and Bas is owner of a paragliding school. Enough about work; we both love to travel, far away or closeby. Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria or Italy. I myself love cooking, running (great combination ;-)), shopping and reading. And I hate how boring my life looks compared to Bas' ;-). 
Oh and we do have other things in common, we both love watching movies and series! 

We bought our house in March '15. With an extensive renovation (in both time and euro's) we turned it into our perfect little Amsterdam-palace  and we treat it with care.

When we are travelling we also like to offer other nice people the opportunity to stay in our luxurious apartment in the city centre of Amsterdam. Please check out our advertisement to see if our apartment is the one you are looking for!

Best regards,

Stance and Titus

I’m a mum of 4 (aged 18, 17, 12, 11) and teaching Dutch at secondary school/ high school is what I do for a living.

I love living on the water because of the feeling of freedom. Waking up, but not awake yet (…), I prefer sitting on my sup with my labradoodle Cooper and paddle relaxed across ‘De Nieuwe Meer’ to the ‘Amsterdamse Bos’, walking and playing there, take a swim and sup back to my house. 

When going on vacation, water is also almost always involved, from the beaches of  Dutch island ‘Texel’ to a stay at the harbour of Valencia. I also love citytripping, especially together with one of my girls.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.
