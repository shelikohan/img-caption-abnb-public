I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

We love art and music which recurs by large paintings and photographs (made by ourselves or 'real' artists), the piano and amazing sound system upstairs in the living room.

Before living in Amsterdam, I have lived and worked in France, Belgium and in the UK. When abroad, I like staying in a private place instead of a hotel, because it is more relaxed and easier to get a feel for the city I am in. What I like about Amsterdam  is that it has a big city vibe and open mindedness, together with a small village feel and relaxedness - the greenery, the parks, the river, the walkable size.
